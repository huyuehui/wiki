* Exercise 6.5[fn:1]
The type of each word used  by IntSet is uint64, but 64-bit arithmetic
may be inefficient on a 32-bit platform. Modify the program to use the
uint type, which  is the most efficient unsigned integer  type for the
platform. Instead  of dividing  by 64, define  a constant  holding the
effective size  of uint  in bits, 32  or 64. You  can use  the perhaps
too-clever expression ~32 << (^uint(0) >> 63)~ for this purpose.

** ^
The operator  ^ is bitwise  exclusive OR (XOR)  when used as  a binary
operator,  but when  used as  a unary  prefix operator  it is  bitwise
negation or complement;  that is, it returns a value  with each bit in
its operand inverted.[fn:2]

** Operator Precedence
Unary operators have the highest precedence:[fn:3]
~(^uint(0) >> 63)~ is the same as ~((^uint(0)) >> 63)~

** ~32 << (^uint(0) >> 63)~
If uint is 32-bit,  this expression equals to ~32 << 0  = 32~. If uint
is 64-bit, it equals to ~32 << 1 = 64~

* Caveat: An Interface Containing a Nil Pointer Is Non-Nil[fn:4]
~var w io.Writer~
In Go, variables  are always initialized to a  well-defined value, and
interfaces are no exception. The zero  value for an interface has both
its type and value components set to nil.

An  interface value  is  described  as nil  or  non-nil  based on  its
*dynamic* type, so this is a nil interface value.[fn:6]

"A  variable of  interface  type  stores a  pair:  the concrete  value
assigned to the variable, and that value's type descriptor. To be more
precise,  the  value  is  the   underlying  concrete  data  item  that
implements the interface and the type  describes the full type of that
item."[fn:5]
